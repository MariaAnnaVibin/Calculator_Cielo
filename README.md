### Project Description
This project involves building a web application where users can interact via voice commands. The application records the user’s voice, sends the audio to a back-end server for speech-to-text conversion, processes the text using the Gemini API (or a similar service), and finally converts the Gemini API’s response back into speech. The response is then sent back to the front-end as audio for playback


### The Problem
This project enables users to speak math expressions and hear the results instantly and this would help the visually impaired.

### The Solution
This project solves the problem of making mathematical calculations more accessible by allowing users to simply speak mathematical expressions and receive instant audible results, eliminating the need for manual input.
